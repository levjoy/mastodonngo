  <h2><a id="welcome">Welcome to Mastodon.ngo</a> </h2>

<p>Many NGOs and other nonprofits want to join Mastodon servers that are aligned with their values and administered by trusted people, but they don't know where to start. Some stick to the big instances. Others need to convince their internal IT departments to experiment with their own servers. Still others find all of this too stressful and confusing too deal with.</p>

<p>We created mastodon.ngo to give NGOs and nonprofits a safe, trusted home in the fediverse. Mastodon.ngo is administered by Hapee from <a href="https://greenhost.nl">Greenhost</a>, Josh from <a href="https://digiresilience.org">Center for Digital Resilience</a>, and Gillo, an information security specialist. We are experienced technologists working in human rights and security and we're dedicated to providing an accessible and sustainable platform for organizations and their staff. We are acting in our individual capacities and our collective organizations are not involved with this instance. </p>

<p>Here are some things to help get you started:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unlike other social media sites, <strong>Mastodon doesn&#39;t present you with suggested accounts to follow</strong>. Instead, it&#39;s important to do some work at the start to find good people to follow. </li>

<li><strong>Check out the &quot;Federated&quot; tab to the right of the page.</strong> It&#39;s a feed of all the accounts that current mastodon.ngo users follow, with some other accounts followed by <em>those</em> accounts thrown in. Follow people liberally. aOnce you do this, you will see their posts and their &quot;boosts&quot; (reposts) in your feed. You may also want to follow the boosted accounts. You can always unfollow accounts later; what&#39;s important is that you start getting a taste of who is out there, and what they are talking about. </li>

<li><strong>Search hashtags</strong>. Since there is no global search in Mastodon (you can only search for people and hashtags), hashtags are important. And they work differently in Mastodon than in Twitter. In Mastodon, they help you find and join conversations. Check out the hashtags to the right of the Mastodon homepage under &quot;Explore.&quot;</li>

<li>You can <strong>follow hashtags</strong> so that posts with them appear in your feed. Click the icon to the top right when conducting a search. </li>

<p><em>Note: Hashtags also let <em>other</em> people see <em>you</em>. If you want to be discovered by likeminded folks, use hashtags!</em></p> 

<li><strong>Federation is complicated</strong>. When you follow the suggestions above, you&#39;ll start seeing more and more posts in your feed, and you can start interacting with more and more people. However, you&#39;re only seeing the people and the posts that our particular server knows about (based on people and instances that are followed by mastodon.ngo users). There are thousands of servers, and millions of people, out there. As this instance grows and, especially, as our users follow more people, we will be exposed to more servers and thus, more people. That, in turn, will make hashtag searches more useful and will help you be discovered by others.</li>

<li><strong>Check out the &quot;Local&quot; feed</strong>. It&#39;s only posts from mastodon.ngo users. It&#39;s a fun way to find out who else is here. </lie>

<li>Here are some other good tips from <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@liztai/109678901153556071">@liztai@hachyderm.io</a>:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>1) Follow people who engage, are kind &amp; classy
2) Respond to people&#39;s posts. Don&#39;t just blast your content &amp; ignore. 
3) Block mercilessly. Don&#39;t bother engaging with trolls.
4) Follow happy hashtags like #catsofmastodon and #Bookstodon</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<p>Have fun! It takes some time to unwind the behaviors that algorithmic social media has ingrained in us. Mastodon isn&#39;t about how many followers you have, or making that perfect comment on a trending topic. It&#39;s not about being aggressive and angry. It was intentionally designed to encourage a friendly, respectful conversational flow that, over time, you might find pretty fun and relaxing. Rather than walk away feeling anxious and angry, you may find yourself feeling happy knowing that you are part of a  safe, friendly online community.</p>
